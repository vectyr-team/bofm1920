Updates to this edition

Items that were missing from the 1920 edition that were added back:
- Added "persecuting," in Alma 1:32
- Added "the pains that I do suffer," In Mosiah 18:15
- Added "according to the crime which he hath committed," to Mosiah 28:15
- Added “And now behold, will this not strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith, for ye will say, I know that this is a good seed, for behold, it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.” to Alma 32:33 from the printer’s manuscript.
- Added "upon the Gentiles," to 3 Nephi 20:27

These words were updated because "burthen" is a very archaic version of "burden" and "burden" is already used elsewhere in the text.
- Changed "burthens" in 1 Nephi 2:23 and Alma 62:29 to "burdens"
- Changed "burthensome" in Mosiah 6:7 to "burdensome"
